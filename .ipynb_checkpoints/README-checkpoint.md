## Executive Summary:  Shifts in Political Sentiment in Orange County, CA

The state of California is known as a solidly Democratic state.  However, it wasn't always that way.  Recall, this is the state that gave us notable Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, not to mention the Republican "Governator", Arnold Schwatzeneggar.

Orange County, south of Los Angeles, is a historically a solid Republican county.  However, in 2018, the county elected a slate of Democrats to represent them in Congress.  

This study examines the connection between demographic and economic factors and voting results in Orange County in 2018, seeking to identify predictive factors in election outcomes.   

We will map these factors onto a street map of Orange County to help individual voters understand the magntitude of the changes happening in on their block, in their community, and in the surrounding areas.  Our intent is to make politics more accessible to the individual, and less "just something that's discussed on TV".

This creates a framework that could be applied to other counties in California, as well as other states.
